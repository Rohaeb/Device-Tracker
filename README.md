# Device-Tracker
As a Computer support specialist at my company, one of my primary tasks were to track down computers that belonged to terminated employees. Overtime, I started to realize that I was spending to long using different resources to find all the info for a device. I wanted to reduce the time it took and and be able to find the device faster. 
Steps needed to look for a device:
1) Use Microsft Intune to look for device and find IP address
2) use an Excel sheet to find what site had this IP address
3) use another excel sheet to find who managed that site
4) use Intune to find out revalant info such as specs to see it can be used for another hire
   As you can see there is many steps involved for one device, and Intune would run into issues as it would take a long time to spit out the data, or would deliver no data when to many requests were being done. I created a GUI where multiple excel sheets are downloaded into a single GUI, and reduces the time it takes for data to be outputted. I was able to then get fast and accurate data for each device. I am working on getting those Excel sheets downloaded weekly to have fresh data for each devices.
